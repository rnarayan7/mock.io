                        Mock is a platform by which individuals can connect
                        with one another for the purpose of conducting mock
                        interviews. It provides a method by which people who
                        have already received offers from a specific company,
                        or even seasoned interviewers can source themselves for
                        interviews. As a job seeker, it is the perfect tool for
                        receiving personalized help towards landing one's dream
                        offer.

                        Mock was initially built to cater to university
                        students, given that at many schools, students are
                        unable to find the necessary help to prepare for
                        specific interviews. As of now, it continues to serve
                        university students as its primary goal, but the
                        development team is looking to expand its usage to
                        other target groups.

                        Mock's first home was at the University of Michigan.
                        While studying there, Roshan identified some of the
                        shortcomings of the College of Engineering's Career
                        Resource Center, specifically its inability to provide
                        personalized interviews for roles in software
                        engineering. Aiming to build a better system to help
                        Michigan students, he created Mock and pitched it first
                        to fellow peers. Some of them were the first ever to
                        use the platform.

                        This idea came to reality largely due to the teachings
                        of two classes in the University of Michigan School of
                        Information, Succeeding at Failing: The Art of
                        Entrepeneurship in the Age of Information (SI 360) and
                        Accessible Web Design (SI 339). Various aspects of the
                        product design and business model came from a startup
                        pitch challenge in SI 360 and the design techniques
                        taught in SI 339 aided in developing the first
                        iterations of the product.
