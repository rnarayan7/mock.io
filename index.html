                        Mock is a platform by which individuals can connect
                        with one another for the purpose of conducting mock
                        interviews. It provides a method by which people who
                        have already received offers from a specific company,
                        or even seasoned interviewers can source themselves for
                        interviews. As a job seeker, it is the perfect tool for
                        receiving personalized help towards landing one's dream
                        offer.

                        Mock was initially built to cater to university
                        students, given that at many schools, students are
                        unable to find the necessary help to prepare for
                        specific interviews. As of now, it continues to serve
                        university students as its primary goal, but the
                        development team is looking to expand its usage to
                        other target groups.

                        Mock is a simple application to use, and requires only
                        a few basic steps. First, register for an account on
                        the profile page. From then on, only access your
                        account by logging in. Once having logged in, navigate
                        to the schedule page. Here, you can state your
                        preferences for a mock interview, including time, area
                        of focus, and desired interviewer experience. Finally,
                        you will be sent to the interview page, which will
                        allow you to select from multiple interview choices,
                        such that you can pick the one that works best for you.

                        Roshan is an aspiring computer science student pursuing
                        his bachelor's in CS from the College of Engineering at
                        the University of Michigan. In addition to his
                        engineering education, he has taken multiple classes
                        in the school of information, which helped him grow his
                        understanding of how technology interacts with
                        end-users, and how to build software that truly adds
                        value to people's lives. He has worked for Stryker
                        Corporation and Capital One, and will be interning at
                        Salesforce as a software engineering intern in the
                        summer of 2019. In addition to development, Roshan
                        enjoys dancing, playing basketball, reading, and is
                        hoping to become a successful entrepeneur throughout
                        the course of his career.

                        Mock's first home was at the University of Michigan.
                        While studying there, Roshan identified some of the
                        shortcomings of the College of Engineering's Career
                        Resource Center, specifically its inability to provide
                        personalized interviews for roles in software
                        engineering. Aiming to build a better system to help
                        Michigan students, he created Mock and pitched it first
                        to fellow peers. Some of them were the first ever to
                        use the platform.

                        This idea came to reality largely due to the teachings

                        Entrepeneurship in the Age of Information (SI 360) and

                        taught in SI 339 aided in developing the first
